                  <h4><a>How AI is searching for Aliens: The Age of AI</a></h4>
                  <p class="separator">Human reason and artificial intelligence function on distinct levels. In advanced artificial neural networks, the modes of cognition—the logical steps underlying any given conclusion—are utterly unintelligible, even to their designers, as articulated by many futurists and engineers. This artificial intelligence will fundamentally alter our societal structure, personal relationships, and way of thinking over the next few years. Two books—one from the West and the other from the East—that were released back-to-back this year are based on that idea.
                  The Age of AI is a series of YouTube original documentaries, showing us just how our modern lifestyles are unimaginable without artificial intelligence. From finance, entertainment, and cognitive psychology, robotics and finally to astronomy, AI helps us make groundbreaking new discoveries more quickly than ever before.
                  Signal analysis is done largely by intelligent machines that are trying to detect interesting cosmic events in the sea of non-living objects such as asteroids, cosmic dust, and dwarf stars. Thanks to AI, humans are now able to look deep into space and make meaningful conclusions about the presence of intelligent life on astronomical bodies. I do think we're going to find extraterrestrials, I do think we're going to find signs of civilization beyond Earth, and I do think it's going to be AI that finds it.

                  <h4><a href="blog-single.html">Saving the world one algorithm at a time: The Age of AI</a></h4>
                  <p class="separator">The idea of algorithmic bias is intriguing: it occurs when a computer system behaves in ways that are reflective of the beliefs or preferences of the people who worked on its design or data collection. In essence, it's similar to reading a story in a newspaper that expresses the viewpoints and political leanings of the person who wrote it. We are extremely familiar with this idea, but while the majority of us can apply critical thinking to an article's substance and read between the lines, it is much harder to do the same with an algorithm. As a result, we assign this task to the faith we have in an organization.
                  In fact, a programmer would create an algorithm in a typical system, which would be given data, and you would receive a response. In the future, a computer would be fed a ton of data and the results that corresponded with it, and it would create an algorithm. a logic-based algorithm that is alien.
                  The question of how to ensure that this new army of AI-based decision makers is and remains ethical arises since humankind should be concerned with improving the planet. AI is not a new scourge; rather, it is essential for improving humans and leading more satisfying lives.

                  <h4><a href="blog-single.html">Will Robot take my Job: The Age of AI</a></h4>
                  <p class="separator">Industrial robots are mechanical arms that may be programmed to move a tool through a series of actions, such as a paint sprayer or a welding torch. Computer-controlled steel mills that can be run by a small number of personnel are another example of automation. Since the 1970s, there have been increasingly more of these robots employed. Approximately 2 million industrial robots are currently employed globally, primarily on assembly lines for automobiles and electronics, and each one replaces one or more human workers.
                  Another reason economists like Bessen don't see AI generating mass unemployment anytime soon is the technology's limits. He states, in agreement with many others, "Automation is nearly always about automating a task, not the complete job." There are also very few jobs that are entirely routine, despite the fact that every employment involves at least a few regular tasks that may use AI. In fact, according to Bessen, of the 50,000 employment recorded in the 1950 census, "there was only one occupation that you could argue was definitively automated out of existence - elevator operators," and today there are practically none.

                  <p class="separator">Mars exploration had a landmark month in February 2021. While the first successful rover was launched in 1997 after the first successful landing on the surface of Mars in 1971, humans have been exploring the red planet for well over 50 years. This year has also seen a number of firsts, including the launch of three simultaneous probes by China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates.
                  Despite the fact that each expedition has a different set of goals, by analyzing the landscape, gathering samples, and using a variety of other research techniques, they will expand the body of knowledge that is already available. Elon Musk thinks that manned spacecraft will land on Mars in 2022, and these recent missions try to clear the path for that to happen while also illuminating the numerous mysteries surrounding the planet. With 3D printers, automated systems, and cutting-edge building technology, some architects have started exploring the various methods that could facilitate human colonization beyond the planet Earth.  Even NASA has launched competitions such as the “3D Printed Habitat Challenge”, the likes of which have played a fundamental role in exploring news technologies and methods in space exploration.

                  <p class="separator">Though its importance is growing daily, will artificial intelligence ever be able to produce works of art? Machine learning is what determines the response to that query. Even while AI is capable of producing works of art, its operations are not yet fully autonomous. There is no proof that AI will ever generate art that is on par with human creativity because it still has its own prejudices. Nevertheless, as technology develops, AI-generated art will surely get better. The process of creating AI-generated art is fairly simple. Simply describe the subject and choose a style, and within 20 seconds the application displays the finished product. It is amazing to see how quickly this technology can evolve and produce art. It can also be used to create art for the public to view. Ultimately, AI-generated art can be a valuable addition to any museum. So far, no museum has offered a complete AI-generated artwork.
  
                  Now that the vehicle is autonomous, a steering console is not required, hence none is found. However, there is something "inside" the car—just the two seats. Because they look like bucket seats, these seats are designed to make you feel as though you are floating. To do this, a suspension system is installed directly behind the buckets.The black arms that protrude from the back of the EXP and connect to the seats are the suspension systems, which are visible from the side or rear views of the car. We don't know what's inside or how they work, but on paper, they appear to be functional.

                  <h4><a href="blog-single.html">Using AI to build a better human: The Age of AI</a></h4>
                  <p class="separator">The discussion of artificial intelligence is frequently framed in terms of its possible abuse or risks, racial data bias, improper use of facial recognition software by governments and businesses, or the detrimental effects of its implementation on the labor market and society at general (job losses, humans becoming data farms, robotized societies). But what if AI could be used to create a better human?
                  This includes using AI for voice recognition or translation, higher levels of manufacturing automation, facial recognition, or even analysis and behavioral forecasting in the legaltech, fintech, medtech, and other fields. The fact is that AI can help people improve as individuals.
                  Consider the health applications and wearables that offer customized versions using a combination of cloud computing and local data and use. They are only one step away from advising you to make health-related choices that will help you stay healthy. We shouldn't view AI as either something we can or cannot trust or as something we should or should not believe in. We should view AI and its potential as an instrument for improvement that we are in control of.
                  Only considering the "dangers" or "benefits," the good or bad, simply puts us in a passive mindset and makes us believe that we are powerless over our own actions, when in fact, this new wave of technology and the development of quantum computing will greatly increase and multiply our abilities as people. Ral Suárez Banegas, Head of Corporate Business at LinkedIn, gave a landmark presentation at the recent AI Show in Madrid, and I had the good fortune to be one of the presenters there.  AI is being used by LinkedIn to classify and present results. Their goal is to usher in a new era of careers marked by "Talent Intelligence." Talent intelligence is the application of data, reporting, and artificial intelligence to make talent a company's or business's competitive edge. In order to hire the greatest employees, "the best organizations will use artificial intelligence applied to data," he said. In order to determine applicants and options, LinkedIn analyzes a vast network of user data, company data, job descriptions, skills, schools, and educational background.

                  <h4><a href="blog-single.html">Healed through AI: The Age of AI</a></h4>
                  <p class="separator">Because of the miracles of artificial intelligence, the human body is not perfect. Research
                  experts are figuring out how to fix those flaws. A.I. has the capacity to improve, enhance, and
                  compensate for the deficiencies in our bodies.
                  Initially, doctors were to be replaced with artificial intelligence. Robots that could ask you
                  questions, process your responses using an algorithm that would get smarter with practice, and
                  determine whether you were sick with the flu or a cold were the stuff of researchers&#39;
                  imaginations. These promises, however, largely fell short because the artificial intelligence
                  algorithms were inadequate to carry out those tasks. The heterogeneity across individuals was
                  particularly challenging since it prevented machine learning systems from seeing the patterns.
                  But eventually, a branch of AI known as deep learning developed the sensitivity to distinguish
                  speech from voice data. Deep learning algorithms may eventually learn to detect words regardless
                  of accents and other variations in speech patterns, despite the fact that they needed a lot of
                  training data.

                  <p class="separator">Artificial intelligence (AI), which stands for systems or machines that resemble human intelligence to complete tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they acquire, is most commonly used to describe such systems or machines. I get the impression that many individuals are fascinated by the promise of AI. These breakthroughs imply some amazing things and potential benefits, but there are also possible undesirable consequences, as suggested by the cautionary title. We must consider our future plans as well as our needs and desires from technology.
                  Technology is developing more quickly than ever before, and it is taking less time for it to become widely used. From writing to printing press, it took around 10,000 years, but just another 500 years for e-mail to be invented. It appears that a new era is just beginning. The era of AI A subfield of computer science called artificial intelligence (AI) studies how to simulate intelligent behavior in machines. AI is educating the machine, which makes it smarter. There was a time when only humans possessed intelligence, but that is no longer the case. The machines aren't programmed by us. Individually, they develop.
